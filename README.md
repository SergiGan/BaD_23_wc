Description and action:

This program algorithm performs the following:

- the program accepts an arbitrary text as input and finds in each word of this text the very first symbol that is no longer repeated in the analyzed word;
- further, the program selects the first unique character (the one that is no longer found in the given set) from the received set of characters and returns it.\
For example, if a program receives the input text below:  
  >The Tao gave birth to machine language.  
    Machine language gave birth to the assembler.\
    The assembler gave birth to the compiler.\
    Now there are ten thousand languages.\
    Each language has its purpose, however humble.\
    Each language expresses the Yin and Yang of software.  
    Each language has its place within the Tao.\
    But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.

        _Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming".
    you need to return its symbol "m".

First of all we need to do next:

- [ ] A.1 Install the version node.js supported by your OS 
- [ ] A.2
- [ ] A.3
  - [ ] SubAct 1
  - [ ] SubAct 2
  - Run App.js

@And to test the operation of the program, we will apply it to this string: \

but when you do, it blows away your whole leg. (—Å) Bjarne Stroustrup`
